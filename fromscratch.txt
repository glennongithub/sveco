As in https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/homestead
To create machine for project 

In folder you want to use for project
composer require laravel/homestead --dev
vendor\\bin\\homestead make    (mac/linux php vendor/bin/homestead make)

Edit Homestead.yml acording to your wiches
in our case

ip: 192.168.19.14
memory: 2048
cpus: 1
provider: virtualbox
authorize: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
keys:
    - ~/.ssh/id_rsa
folders:
    -
        map: '.'
        to: /home/vagrant/code
        type: "nfs"
sites:
    -
        map: sveco.test
        to: /home/vagrant/code/application/public
        type: symfony4
databases:
    - sveco
name: sveco-dev
hostname: sveco-dev


make sure hoste file is updated acoringly

then vagrant up

the ssh into your newly created machine
vagrant ssh sveco-dev   (or whatever name you chose in obove config)

then 
cd code   (or whatever path used in above config)

then
composer create-project symfony/skeleton application  (use application as project-name to make it easier to use same code everywhere)

then go to https://sveco.dev/index.php

installera annotations och twig och security

cd /home/vagrant/code/application
composer require annotations
composer require twig


installera ngt som behövs för security annotations
composer require symfony/expression-language


composer require asset


install ionic
---tobe added

now symlink that www folder of newly created ionic app to public
ln -s /home/vagrant/code/sveco-webapp/www/ /home/vagrant/code/application/public/app

also make sure to add that above line to after.sh so it's done when provisioned
